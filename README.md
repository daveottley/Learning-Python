# Learning-Python

This project is a container holding each of my toy Python projects. Each project has its own dependencies.
All projects in this repository require Python 3.13.1.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/daveottley/Learning-Python.git
'''

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
'''bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
'''

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
 python3 project_name.py --your-flags
   It is often useful to make an alias to useful projects like so:
     alias project='python3 project_name.py --your-flags'


#### Contributing

However, contributions are always welcome! Submit a pull request or open an issue.
